<p style="text-align:center">Time Series Ensemble LGBM â€“ ARIMA</p>
In this article, I am going to showcase the predictive power of ensemble learning for time series forecasting. Ensemble learning leads to models with higher predictive accuracy, a lower likelihood of overfitting, and a diverse set of predictions.

I will be using a dataset provided by ASHRAE (The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) which has hourly meterage data on electricity, chilled water, steam, and hot water. In the following cell, we will import the necessary python packages, the meterage data, and the building metadata.
